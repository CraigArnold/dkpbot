# dkpbot
Discord bot to record and maintain raid attendance and loot distribution.

Most mmo guilds are already using discord for text and voicechat. dkpbot consolidates your dkp management into your existing discord server. This allows you to
ditch the hassle of maintaining a 2nd website with seperate login credentials and authorization
settings.

all interaction is done through text commands in discord, which i will explain here once I
figure that all out.
